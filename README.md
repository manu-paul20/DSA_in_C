 <h1>DSA Repository - Algorithms and Data Structures</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the <strong>DSA Repository</strong>! This project, maintained by <strong>Manu Paul</strong>, is designed to provide a collection of essential Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) with clear implementations and explanations.</p>
    
    <h2>Topics Covered</h2>
    <p>This repository covers fundamental algorithms and data structures, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Linear Search</strong><br>A simple search algorithm that checks each element in the array sequentially.</li>
        <li><strong>Binary Search</strong><br>A more efficient search algorithm for sorted arrays that reduces the search space by half at each step.</li>
        <li><strong>Sorting Algorithms</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Bubble Sort</li>
                <li>Insertion Sort</li>
                <li>Merge Sort</li>
                <li>Quick Sort</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Linked Lists</strong><br>A linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, each pointing to the next node.</li>
        <li><strong>Stacks and Queues</strong><br>Basic data structures with LIFO (Last In First Out) and FIFO (First In First Out) principles.</li>
        <li><strong>Trees and Graphs</strong><br>Non-linear data structures used for hierarchical data representation and networked data models.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Programming</strong><br>An optimization technique for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>Each algorithm is implemented in <strong>C++/Python/Java</strong> (or your chosen language) with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Clear explanations</li>
        <li>Time and space complexity analysis</li>
        <li>Example use cases</li>
    </ul>
